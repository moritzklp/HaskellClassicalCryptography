\section{Helper Functions}
\label{sec:helper-functions}

In this section we define functions that are essential for our implementation of the OTP cipher.
The code below shows our Haskell implementation, which includes a function to perform the bitwise XOR operation on two byte strings. 
This functionality is a key component in both the encryption and decryption process and in demonstrating the Many-Time Pad attack.

The module \texttt{Pad} is defined and exports the \texttt{padString} function. 
It imports libraries from \texttt{Data.ByteString} and \texttt{Data.ByteString.Char8} 
for efficient handling of binary and character data, and \texttt{Data.Bits} for bitwise operations.

\begin{code}
module Pad (xorBytes, padString) where

import qualified Data.ByteString as B
import qualified Data.ByteString.Char8 as C
import Data.Bits (xor)
\end{code}

Th \texttt{xorBytes} function takes two \texttt{ByteString} arguments and applies a pair-wise XOR operation using \texttt{B.zipWith xor}. 
The result is packed back into a \texttt{ByteString} using \texttt{B.pack}. 
This operation is key in combining the plaintext with the key in an OTP cipher.

\begin{code}
xorBytes :: B.ByteString -> B.ByteString -> B.ByteString
xorBytes bs1 bs2 = B.pack (B.zipWith xor bs1 bs2)
\end{code}

The \texttt{padString} function takes two strings, converts them into \texttt{ByteString}s, 
and then applies the \texttt{xorBytes} function. Finally, it converts the result back into a string. 
This process effectively “pads” one string with another using the XOR operation.

\begin{code}
padString :: String -> String -> String
padString s1 s2 = C.unpack $ xorBytes (C.pack s1) (C.pack s2)
\end{code}
